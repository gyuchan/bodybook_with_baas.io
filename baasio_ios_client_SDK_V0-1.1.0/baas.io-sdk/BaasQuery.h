 adds a requirement to the query. The requirements will
 *all* be sent when the query is adopted. This is an escalating
 list as you add them. Requirements are in UG Querty language.
 So something like "firstname='bob'". This is one of the few places
 where the data you give will be sent to the server almost untouched.
 So if you make a mistake in your query, you are likely to cause the whole
 transaction to return an error.
 NOTE: This is different thant URL terms. These are query terms sent along
 to the *single* URL term "ql".
 Note: This is an oblique-usage function. You will find all the ql operations
 supported in the various addRequiredXXXX functions above. You would only use
 this function if you already have ql strings prepared for some reason, or if
 there are new ql format operations that are not supported by this API.
